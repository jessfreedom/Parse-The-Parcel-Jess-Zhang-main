## Jess Zhang's Solution ##

To run the program, make sure python 3.x is installed. Then, run the following:

>python main.py --weight=WEIGHT DIMENSION1 DIMENSION2 DIMENSION3

e.g.


    python main.py --weight=10 150 200 100 
The above example is for a parcel that weights 10kg, with dimensions of 150mm x 200mm x 100mm

(The order of the dimension specified in the arguments does not matter).

For help, run:

    python main.py --help
